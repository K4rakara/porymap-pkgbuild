# Porymap-Pkgbuild

This repository provides a `PKGBUILD` script for [Porymap](), allowing it to be installed on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) through the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org).

### Installation

I'm still working on actually getting this package on the AUR, so you can't install it with `yay` at the minute.

For the time being, it can be installed with the following commands (requires `pacman`, `makepkg`, and `git`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/K4rakara/porymap-pkgbuild
cd porymap-pkgbuild
makepkg -is
```
